# Worly
Worly is my 2nd year (2020-2021) software project, where I worked in collaboration to develop a software program. 

In second year we were tasked to develop an application that targeted one of the United Nation's Sustainable Goals. After brainstorming ideas for the project, my team decided to target Climate Action.
Check out our [brainstorming activity](https://www.mindmeister.com/app/map/2879832123?t=70Axe9tA3h)

Worly is a web application that has two type of users:
1. Regular Users:
    - Worly allows regular users to take quizes. 
    - Then captures the user's carbon footprint depending on the answers they have chosen, alongside showing them the results and tips on reducing their footprint.
2. Administrators
    - Administrators are able to create new quiz templates consisting of questions, and answers.

## Worly's Project worflow:
1. Brainstorming & pitching ideas.
2. Creating initial designs as a starting points. Checkout Wory's [Design](/Design/)
3. Scrum Planning.
4. Sprint Planning and retrospective. [Run Worly](/Worly)
    - Simultaneously, learning technologies and using the knowledge to implement features within sprints. 
5. Presenting Worly to panel of supervisors.

## Software Development Lifecycle used:  
- SCRUM 
- Worly was developed during COVID-19 lockdown, therefore, we were not able to fully take advantage of SCRUM SDLC. 
- For example: We could not carry on daily _stand-ups_ everyday, due to social  distancing. However, me and my another colleague who were specifically working on the backend of Worly incorporated _Daily Handovers_ where we briefed each other on which functionalities we worked on, things that went well and things that we can improve on.


## Personal Development Outcome:
- Acquired Agile mindset: (Ability to prioritise tasks)
- Acquired experience of working with a team to develop a software. 
- Learnt back-end technologies like: GIT/GITHUB, Springboot, Thymeleaf, SQL, REST API, Junit testing, etc.
- Learnt the importance of improving the readability of the code. 
- Gained first-hand experience of leading a team.

## Sidenote 
<p> Typically, a Front-End server such as react will handle the page rendering and display, which will send HTTP requests (usually Axiom for React JS) to the Back-End server (Spring Boot). However, due to time constraints, the user will directly interact with the backend which is then responsible for both display and business logic. SpringBoot utilises a technology called Thymeleaf and will render the HTML pages we have configured in the Resources folder as a result. </p>
